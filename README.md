# PioT
Files, scripting, and resources for the PioT project
PioT was developed as a GCIA Gold Paper in conjunction with the SANS Institute. The core concept was to create an inline device to proxy traffic intended for a vulnerable IoT device (open access, known hardcoded credentials, etc.) 
While the basics were created as part of the paper, the solution is capable of being expanded into something that has a lot of utility. However, my time is limited so the purpose of this repository is to allow others who are willing to assist in the continued enhancement of PioT.
